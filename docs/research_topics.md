Anscombe's quartet comprises four datasets that have nearly identical simple 
statistical properties, yet appear very different when graphed. Each dataset 
consists of eleven (x,y) points. They were constructed in 1973 by the 
statistician Francis Anscombe to demonstrate both the importance of graphing 
data before analyzing it and the effect of outliers on statistical properties.
